My car’s odometer measures distance traveled in whole numbers – no tenths of miles – up to 999,999. 
Last week I was driving along on the freeway and noticed that the last four digits, but not the last 
five digits, formed a palindrome, that is, read the same backward and forward (e.g., 1221).  
After one mile went by, though, the last five digits did form a palindrome, and then after one more mile, 
the middle four digits formed a palindrome.  Finally, when the third mile rolled over, all six digits formed
a palindrome. What was my original mileage at the time I first noticed all these palindromes.
